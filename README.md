# Durham Bike Co-op #

## I. Website Research ##
I have an interest in cycling and equity. The [Durham Bike Co-op's mission](http://www.durhambikecoop.org/#!our-mission/c14e3) states social equity an important component but this tenant is not reflected on its website in pictures and leadership:

>The Durham Bicycle Cooperative is an all volunteer non-profit 501(c)(3) community bicycle project.
â€‹
We believe bicycles have the power to make our local communities a better place through sound environmental practices, a commitment to sustainable economics and social equality, involvement and outreach with our local community, and promoting cycling as a healthy fitness and wellness activity.>

The League of American Bicyclists has lead the [Equity Initiative](http://www.bikeleague.org/equity) movement and certifies cities as bicycle friendly. The League's equity statement is below followed by Durham's bronze rating report card:

> The goal of the League of American Bicyclists is to make bicycling safe and comfortable for people of all ages in all communities, but we recognize that youth, women and people of color are underrepresented in many bike advocacy efforts and local transportation decisions.>

>Equity issues have been a source of discussion in the bicycle movement for many years. However, there has been a lack of dedicated staff capacity, direct knowledge, and guidance from local leaders of color in engaging in a sustained, strategic dialogue about these issues. Currently there are few resources to address disparities on the ground and equity as it relates specifically to bicycle advocacy.>

Durham has been rated as a [Bronze status for a bicycle friendly community](http://www.bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/bfareportcards/BFC_Fall_2014_ReportCard_Durham_NC.pdf)

#### SWOT as it relates to the Durham Bike Co-op ####
#### Strengths ####
  - Online presence, with animations on website, connection with a Blog and other social media including Facebook and Instagram
  - Strong mission and vision
  - Board of Directors and Coordinators and Corporate Sponsorship
  - Documentation of news through Blog and achievement of Capital Campaign fundraising goal of $50K in 2015
  - Partnerships with many bicycle organizations throughout the RTP area, as noted on the Donate and Sponsor tab, Our Friends
#### Weaknesses ####  
  - Durham is a diverse community with a large population of underrepresented minorities, especially African Americans. However, African Americans are not part of the Board of Directors leadership structure or appearing in many photographs on the website (one photo in the 2014 Annual Report, volunteer of the year is an African American man, two pictures on social media tab).
  - Blog was last updated in March 2016. Vacancy within Leadership of Coordinators, Communications Chair

#### Opportunities ####
 - Lots of opportunities to connect locally with Triangle Bike Works, Active Routes to Schools, civic and community leaders to help improve the holistic health of the Durham community

#### Threats ####
 - Shortage of Volunteers
 - Time/financial limitations to achieve mission, ties in with access to volunteers

## II. Creative Brief ##

#### A. Client Background ####
The Durham Bike Co-op is an all-volunteer 501(c)(3) nonprofit community bicycle project. Our programming includes hands on repair skillshare (helping you fix your bike), an earn-a-bike program (helping you get a bike), and mobile clinics. Volunteers and donations are always welcome!

**Address:**
1612 Acadia Street, Durham, NC 27701

**Email:** contact@durhambikecoop.org


**Repair Shop Hours**


Thursday: 7pm-10pm (suspended until further notice)


Sunday: 2pm-5pm


Sunday: 11am-1pm (New Volunteers)
#### B. Project Overview ####
Enhance the design of the website to better market Durham Bike Co-op to more members of the Durham Community. Increasing participation and ridership will also improve the intercultural community (bridge building amongst residents) and the American League of Bicyclists' report card of Durham as a bicylce friendly city, moving from bronze level to gold perhaps. Increasing ridership will also improve the overall health of Durham by making its community members physically and mentally healthier and by providing a low-cost transportation mode that is also more environmentally friendly. With reliable transportation, the economic health of the community is improved. More people are able to get to and from work, school, etc.

#### C. Project Drivers ####
Board Members, Community Partners (see list below), City Government Officials, Community Groups (Schools, Religous Organizations, etc.), all trying to achiever the mission:

The Atomic Fern, Bike Durham, City of Durham Parks and Recreation Department, Bullseye Bicycles, Church World Service, Durham County Health Department, Durham County Library System, Durham Safe Kids Coalition, East Durham Children's Initiative, John Avery Boys & Girls Club, Moogfest, NC Dept. of Transportation, Oak City Cycling (Raleigh), Scrap Exchange, the ReCyclery - Carrboro, Zog's Art Bar

Mission of the Durham Bike Co-op:
We believe bicycles have the power to make our local communities a better place through sound environmental practices, a commitment to sustainable economics and social equality, involvement and outreach with our local community, and promoting cycling as a healthy fitness and wellness activity. To further that vision, we will:
- Operate a Repair Facility
- Teach Bicycle Repair
- Recover and Redistribute Bicycles
- Operate a Mobile Clinic
- Engage in Recycling and Reuse
- Host Bicycle Social Events
- Promote Fitness
- Collaborate
- Strive to Be Accessible and Inviting (people with disabilities and underrepresented groups)
#### D. Target Audience ####
Kids, Adults, and Families from underrepsented and majority groups

#### E. Tone and Perception ####
Currently, the website does not look inviting to those without bicycle repair knowledge. Photos are not used to show community members participating in the repair hours. Photos of tools can be intimidating to community members who do not know what the tools do. Needs to be more personal to encourage participation, quotes from participants about how participating enchanced their well-being.

#### F. Targeted Message ####
Learn It Earn It Fix It Ride It

Perhaps keep the tagline, very catchy, but have a sub-tagline that is inviting, welcoming, and supportive.

#### G. Project Specifics ####
Add testimonals, photos of participants in action, photos include all audience members, old, young, all races, all socioeconomic backgrounds.

#### H. The Numbers ####
Volunteer service, so no cost to the Durham Bike Co-op.

#### I. People Involved ####
Whitney Edmister, designer, Board of Directors, Community Members
