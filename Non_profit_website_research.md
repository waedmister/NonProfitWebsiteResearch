# Durham Bike Co-op #

I have an interest in cycling and equity. The [Durham Bike Co-op's mission](http://www.durhambikecoop.org/#!our-mission/c14e3) states social equity an important component but this tenant is not reflected on its website in pictures and leadership:

>The Durham Bicycle Cooperative is an all volunteer non-profit 501(c)(3) community bicycle project.
â€‹
We believe bicycles have the power to make our local communities a better place through sound environmental practices, a commitment to sustainable economics and social equality, involvement and outreach with our local community, and promoting cycling as a healthy fitness and wellness activity.>

The League of American Bicyclists has lead the [Equity Initiative](http://www.bikeleague.org/equity) movement and certifies cities as bicycle friendly. The League's equity statement is below followed by Durham's bronze rating report card:

> The goal of the League of American Bicyclists is to make bicycling safe and comfortable for people of all ages in all communities, but we recognize that youth, women and people of color are underrepresented in many bike advocacy efforts and local transportation decisions.>

>Equity issues have been a source of discussion in the bicycle movement for many years. However, there has been a lack of dedicated staff capacity, direct knowledge, and guidance from local leaders of color in engaging in a sustained, strategic dialogue about these issues. Currently there are few resources to address disparities on the ground and equity as it relates specifically to bicycle advocacy.>

Durham has been rated as a [Bronze status for a bicycle friendly community](http://www.bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/bfareportcards/BFC_Fall_2014_ReportCard_Durham_NC.pdf)

## SWOT as it relates to the Durham Bike Co-op ##
### Strengths ###
  - Online presence, with animations on website, connection with a Blog and other social media including Facebook and Instagram
  - Strong mission and vision
  - Board of Directors and Coordinators and Corporate Sponsorship
  - Documentation of news through Blog and achievement of Capital Campaign fundraising goal of $50K in 2015
  - Partnerships with many bicycle organizations throughout the RTP area, as noted on the Donate and Sponsor tab, Our Friends
### Weaknesses ###  
  - Durham is a diverse community with a large population of underrepresented minorities, especially African Americans. However, African Americans are not part of the Board of Directors leadership structure or appearing in many photographs on the website (one photo in the 2014 Annual Report, volunteer of the year is an African American man, two pictures on social media tab).
  - Blog was last updated in March 2016. Vacancy within Leadership of Coordinators, Communications Chair

### Opportunities ###
 - Lots of opportunities to connect locally with Triangle Bike Works, Active Routes to Schools, civic and community leaders to help improve the holistic health of the Durham community

### Threats ###
 - Shortage of Volunteers
 - Time/financial limitations to achieve mission, ties in with access to volunteers
